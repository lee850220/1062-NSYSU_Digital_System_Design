# 1062-NSYSU_Digital_System_Design
## Homework
### HW 1-1
Design a combinational 8-bit adder/subtractor by using both verilog **RTL** and **gate-level** codes. see [**HW1-1.pdf**](https://github.com/lee850220/1062-NSYSU_Digital_System_Design/blob/master/HW1-1/HW1-1.pdf) in detail.

### HW 1-2
Use **Synopsys Design Vision EDA tool** to synthesize project [**HW1-1**](https://github.com/lee850220/1062-NSYSU_Digital_System_Design/tree/master/HW1-1)

### HW 2
(Paperback) Draw the design of **Ripple Carry Adder**, **Carry Lookahead Adder based on BCLG**, **Carry-Skip Adder**, **Carry-Select Adder** and determine the gate count and worst-case delay, also need to draw the longest path.

### HW 3
Design a traffic light controller by using verilog **RTL** code. See [**Homework3.pdf**](https://github.com/lee850220/1062-NSYSU_Digital_System_Design/blob/master/HW3/Homework3.pdf) in detail.

### HW Bouns

## Final Project
Design a signed 16-bit multiplier by using 0.13um manufacture procedure.

We use **Booth Radix-4 Encoder**, **Wallace Tree**, and **Square Root Carry Select Adder** to implement it.

See [**Project.pdf**](https://github.com/lee850220/1062-NSYSU_Digital_System_Design/blob/master/Project/Project.pdf) in detail.
